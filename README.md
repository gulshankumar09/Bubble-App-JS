# Bubble-App-JS

## Introduction 

It is a simple application using the HTML5 Canvas Element.

Four circles are on the left side of the canvas and are filled with different colours.

Arrows corresponding to each circle are on the right side of the canvas.

All the circles and arrows are drawn on a single canvas element.

When you click inside any circle, the arrow to the corresponding circle starts moving towards the circle. Hit it.

The colour of the circle changes once the arrow hits it.

A reset button is there, which resets the application to its initial state.
